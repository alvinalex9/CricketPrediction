# CricketPrediction
Predict a cricket match ball by ball. Simulation of a cricket match using Big Data analysis.

#How to run
cd ipl/run
vi runme.py
// set ifile variable to input file ie. Match that need to be simulated
python runme.py > out.txt


#Major assumption
Currently, This project can only simulate an already played match, since we need the bating order and bowling order to be know before simulation. ie. Information on which batsman played against which bowler need to be know before simulation. Currently working on it...
